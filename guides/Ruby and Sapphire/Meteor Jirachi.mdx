## Tools

- [mGBA with lua scripts](/mgba-setup)
- [wishmaker lua script](https://github.com/Real96/PokeLua/blob/main/Gen%203/mGBA/RS_RNG_Checksums_mGBA.lua)

### Lua Script Set up

In line 6 of the lua script edit it to the path where your save is located.

```
local savePath = "D:\\Desktop\\mGBA\\battery\\Pokemon - Ruby.sav"  -- Write here the path of your Ruby/Sapphire save file
```

## Step 1: Setting up

1. Open Ruby or Sapphire and load the wishmaker lua script.
2. Open the save menu and pause the game at the last dialogue option over "YES".
3. Note the current time displayed by the lua script.
4. Hold down the `A` button and unpause the game simultaneously.
5. When the lua script time freezes, pause the game and write down that time.

Your save delay will be the time when it froze minus the time when you paused the game.

`Save delay = time froze - time paused`

## Step 2: Hitting the Target Seed

1. Open the lua script in WordPad (or a text editor).
2. Input the time from the target seed under targetHour, targetMinute, targetSecond, and targetSixtiethSecond.
3. Optionally, add your target Jirachi seed (for rng proofs/personal preference) to targetSeed.
4. Advance to the last dialogue of the save menu and hover over "YES".
5. Pause the game.
6. Wait for the in-game time to match the target save time displayed.

- Target save time = save time + delay while saving.

7. Once near your target save time, pause and advance frames manually.

- The default key for advancing frames is `Ctrl + N` for Windows.

8. When on your target save time, hold down `A` and unpause the game simultaneously.

Checksum should now match.

Load the multiboot rom with patch enabled and redeem Jirachi.
