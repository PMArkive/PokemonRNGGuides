## Written guide

1. Save in front of the starter you want, in case you need to reset the game.
1. Choose your starter and stop when you see the `Player received Pokemon` text with the flashing arrow to continue.
1. Go into PokeReader's RNG screen and wait until it stops saying `Finding ADIV Index` and `Finding SDIV Index`.
1. Pause PokeReader with `L + R`.
1. Type the information on PokeReader into the RNG Tool below and press `Generate`.
1. Advance the game with `L` until PokeReader's `Advance` number matches one of the generated `Advance` columns below.
1. (Optional) Create a save state if you're on an emulator, in case you need to reset.
1. When you land on your desired advance, press `A` to accept the Pokemon.
1. If you got your Pokemon, congrats! If not, keep trying! It won't take long.
