RNG manipulation in Gen 4 lets you get the exact Trainer ID (TID) and Secret ID (SID) you want. This is useful for things like shiny Pokémon or Cute Charm abuse. This guide covers how to do it on a physical console for Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.

## Tools

- [PokeFinder](/pokefinder)
- [Mystic Timer](/mystic-timer)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Target in PokeFinder

1. Open PokeFinder to Gen 4 -> IDs.
2. Select the filter for what you're searching for. If going for a specific TID, select `TID` and input the TID you want.
3. You can leave the "Year" at 2000 or set it to another year if you want.
4. Set "Min Delay" to 5000. Lower values are difficult to hit due to timing.
5. "Max Delay" can be set higher if desired, but keep in mind the higher the delay the longer each attempt will take.
6. Search for results. If nothing shows up, you can adjust the "Max Delay" to be higher.
7. Right click on your chosen result, and open "Generate times for seed".

## Step 2: Set Up Mystic Timer

1. In the Gen 4 Seed to Time window, check the seconds box, input 30, then click "Generate".
2. Take note of the target delay listed here.
3. In Mystic Timer, select the "Gen 4" tab.
4. Select the console you are using.
5. Adjust the "Calibrated Delay" for your game:
   - Diamond or Pearl: 600
   - Platinum: 575
6. Enter 30 for "Target Seconds". This should match what's shown in the "Seed to Time" window of PokeFinder.
7. Input the target delay into "Target Delay".
8. Click "Set Timer".

## Step 3: Execute the RNG Attempt

You'll need to adjust Mystic Timer to match your real-world timing. Human error makes it unlikely you'll hit the target delay on the first try.

1. Change the date on the console to one of the results in Seed to Time.
2. Change the clock but don't accept yet.
3. Look at “Minutes Before Target” in Mystic Timer. Subtract that number from the target time when setting your DS clock.
   - Example: Target time is 08:57 and there's a 2 for "Minutes Before Target", so the clock would be set to 08:55.
4. When you press `A` to set the time, start Mystic Timer at the same moment.
5. Open the game when the first timer goes off.
6. Get to the naming screen. Make sure to name your character the same way each time. Take note if you're ending on a lower or upper case screen.
7. Get to the last screen before the TID is generated (see screenshot below). Wait for the second timer to go off and press `A` at the same time.
   - If you don't have enough time to reach the last screen before the timer goes off, find a TID with a higher delay to give more time.

## Step 4: Calibrate If You're Missing

1. Use the "Seed Finder" (in the ID window) to check the TID you got. Input the TID and change date and time to what is in Seed to Time window. Adjust "Max Delay" if target delay is above 6000.
2. Look at the seconds column for a result that has 30 seconds.
3. Check if the delay is also near your target delay.
4. Take note if the delay hit is even or odd. Compare this to your target delay. If both are even or both are odd, then you don't need to do anything else.
   - Otherwise, after naming character, switch to a different letter case screen. Eg. from lower case to upper case. This switches the delay from even to odd or vice versa. Do this every attempt from now on.
   - For Japanese games, switch to a different kana screen, eg. from Hiragana to Katakana.
5. Enter your delay into the "Delay Hit" field in Mystic Timer, then click "Set Timer".
6. Try again with the new adjustments.

## Step 5: Try for Your Target TID

If you're off by 2 - 4 delays, don't change the timer yet. Just try again. Try to be precise each time.
If you are consistently off by 2 delays, try to hit a bit earlier or later depending on which way the delay is.
Eg. if target is 5990 and keep hitting 5992, aim to hit `A` a tad earlier when the last beep happens.
With some practice and consistency, you'll eventually hit your target TID.

In Diamond and Pearl it is possible for the delay to randomly switch from even to odd, or vice versa. When this happens, you'll just have to try again.

## Troubleshooting

**I keep getting 1 delay off! Why is this?**

In the Gen 4 games, the delay can switch between even or odd delays. In doing TID RNG you'll have to swap which you're hitting to be able to land on the delay you want.

To swap from even to odd, or vice versa:

- Change the letter casing after naming your character, eg. from lower case to upper case.
- **OR** Change the year on the console by 1.
