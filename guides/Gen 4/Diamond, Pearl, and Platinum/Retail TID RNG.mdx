## Tools

- [PokeFinder](/pokefinder)
- [Mystic Timer](/mystic-timer)

## Step 1: PokeFinder Set Up

1. Open PokeFinder to Gen 4 -> IDs.
2. Select the filter for what you're searching for. If going for a specific TID, select `TID` and input the TID you want.
3. You can set the "Year" to a desired year or leave it at 2000.
4. Have "Min Delay" be 5000. Anything lower isn't feasible to hit.
5. "Max Delay" can be set higher if desired, but keep in mind the higher the delay the longer each attempt will take.
6. Search for results. If nothing shows up, you can adjust the "Max Delay" to be higher.
7. Right click on your chosen result, and open "Generate times for seed".

## Step 2: Mystic Timer Set Up

1. In the Gen 4 Seed to Time window, check the seconds box, input 30, then click "Generate".
2. Take note of the target delay listed here.
3. In Mystic Timer, select the "Gen 4" tab.
4. Select the console you are using.
5. Adjust the "Calibrated Delay" for your game:
   - Diamond or Pearl: 600
   - Platinum: 575
6. Input 30 for the "Target Seconds". This should match what is the Seed to Time window of PokeFinder.
7. Input the target delay into "Target Delay".
8. Click "Set Timer".

## Step 3: TID RNG Process

Because of human error need to adjust the timer to hit desired delay and time. May take several tries before it's consistent.

1. Change date on the console to one of the results in Seed to Time.
2. Change clock but don't accept yet.
3. Take note if Mystic Timer has a number by "Minutes Before Target". Adjust the time of the console to account for this.
   - Example: Target time is 08:57 and there's a 2 for "Minutes Before Target", so the clock would be set to 08:55.
4. When press `A` to set time, also start Mystic Timer.
5. Open game when first timer goes off.
6. Get to naming screen. Make sure to name character same way each time. Take note if ending on lower or upper case screen.
7. Get to last screen. Wait for second timer to go off and press `A` at the same time.
   - If don't have enough time to get to last screen before timer goes off, find a TID with a higher delay to give more time.

## Step 4: Calibrate

1. Check TID by using Seed Finder part of ID window. Input TID and change date and time to what is in Seed to Time window. Adjust "Max Delay" if target delay is above 6000.
2. Look at seconds column for one near 30.
3. Check if delay hit is near target delay.
4. Take note if delay hit is even or odd. Compare to target delay. If both are even or both are odd, then don't need to do anything.
   - Otherwise, after naming character, switch to different letter case screen. Ex. from lower case to upper case. This switches the delay from even to odd or vice versa. Do this every attempt from now on.
   - For Japanese games, switch to a different kana screen, eg. from Hiragana to Katakana.
5. Input that delay into Mystic Timer for "Delay Hit" and click "Set Timer".
6. Try again with new adjustments.

## Step 4: RNG for the TID

If off by 2-4 delays don't update timer and try again. Try to be precise each time.
If consistently 2 off, try to hit a bit earlier or later depending on which way the delay is.
Eg. if target is 5990 and keep hitting 5992, aim to hit `A` a tad earlier when last beep happens.
It's a matter of time before get target TID.

In Diamond and Pearl it is possible for the delay to randomly switch from even to odd, or vice versa. When this happens, you'll just have to try again.

## Troubleshooting

Off by 1 delay

- need to adjust from even to odd or vice versa
- change letter casing after naming character
