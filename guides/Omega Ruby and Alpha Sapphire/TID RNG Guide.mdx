## Tools

- [A 3DS with PokeReader](/install-pokereader)
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

## Step 1: Setup 3DSRNGTool

1. In the upper right corner, select your game version and click "Advance."
   - Seed and TSV can be blank.
2. In the ID tab, fill in your desired TID, SID, or TSV.
3. 3DSRNGTool can search for multiple numbers partially or fully.
   - Finding a specific TID/SID/TSV combination is very rare. It is advised to RNG for only one at a time.

In this example, we will be getting the highlighted TID.

## Step 2: Setup the game

1. Load the game and select a game language.
2. Continue playing until this screen appears.

## Step 3: Advancing the RNG

Every time "No" is selected when confirming the name, the RNG advances by one. This can be tedious, especially for higher target advances.

1. Type in the TinyMT Seeds shown in PokeReader.
2. Press "Calculate" in the main window to get a list of possible frames for RNG.
3. Adjust the range as needed.
4. If the target frame is too high or the TID/SID/TSV combination is not possible with your seed, reboot the system to start over with a different seed.
   - Rosalina can reboot quickly by pressing `L+Down+Select` and selecting the reboot option.
5. Name your character and confirm the selection.
6. Wait until you can control your character to check if you got your TID/SID/TSV correct.
