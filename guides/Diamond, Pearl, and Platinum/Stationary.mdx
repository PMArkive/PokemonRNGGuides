## Tools

- PokeFinder
- Be in front of your target
- All tools needed to RNG abuse with DesMuMe

## Intro

This guide aims to list Pokémon and highlight any unique traits they have. The RNG process is the same each time, and once you've gone over the Initial Seed Guide and the Advancing Guide, you'll understand the basics.

Make sure to open PokeFinder under Gen 4 => Static.

## Method K List

- Drifloon.
- Spiritomb.
- Rotom.
- Uxie, Azelf.
- Dialga, Palkia.
- Heatran.
- Regigigas.
- Giratina.
- Darkrai (Platinum).
- Shaymin (Platinum).
- Arceus (Platinum).
- Regirock, Regice, Registeel (Platinum).

```
If you want to RNG Giratina in the Distortion World, it's trickier. When you enter the Distortion World, the RNG advances by 11, and you have 12 advances when encountering Giratina. So, you need to factor in an initial advance of 23 since you will load the Distortion World at least once if using the journal method.
```

## Method 1 List

- Sinnoh starters.
- Eevee from Bebe.
- Happiny egg.
- Riolu egg.
- Cresselia (initial advance of 5).
- Mesprit (initial advance of 5).
- Porygon (Platinum).
- Moltres (Platinum).
- Zapdos (Platinum).
- Articuno (Platinum).

```
For Sinnoh starters in DP, save on the route before entering the lake. It will also be easier with a shiny target advance of 0. In Pt, it's more difficult due to noise.
```

```
Cresselia and Mesprit are generated the first time you talk to them, so RNG them before they escape.
```

```
When talking to Prof. Oak for the Kanto birds, Moltres has an initial advance of 1, Zapdos of 6, and Articuno of 11. It’s suggested to use the E4 method: defeat the target, then RNG by talking to Oak again.
```

## Manaphy Egg RNG

The Manaphy egg is received like a Wondercard Pokémon, but it uses Method 1 generation. The Wondercard follows normal RNG rules.

Manaphy has a shiny lock that prevents it from hatching shiny in the game it’s obtained in. To bypass this, RNG the Manaphy to hatch shiny in a different game.

1. Know the shiny PID for Game A.
2. In Game B, obtain the egg with that PID.
3. Trade the egg from Game B to Game A.
4. Hatch the egg in Game A.

Congratulations, you now have a shiny Manaphy!
