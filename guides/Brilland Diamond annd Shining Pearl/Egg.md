For this guide, we'll go more in detail, but it still requires to have the Basic Knowledge guides. Same as for TID / SID guide, we'll use PokeFinder's builds in order to have these done.

Requirement :
- PokeFinder Builds : https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Admiral-Fish/pokefinder
- CaptureSight
- Shining Charm AND/OR Masuda.
- Fly

As said in the requirements, Shiny Charm or Masuda will be a MUST HAVE in order to make this RNG. To explain why, egg is generated when you pick it from the old man if you don't have either the SC or Masuda. So you'll have to do a RNG on a really noisy place. You don't want that. Using Masuda or SC makes that the egg is generated when it's held and so only based on the step counter. That way you can RNG it on a quiet place like we'll explain on that guide.

Note : It's not necessary to put any delay if you go in the right place

Note : Egg is the only RNG atm where TID / SID is necessary. So you'll have to do a profile on the PokeFinder profile tab, with your TID / SID being known. You can use Pkhex or any other method to get these informations.

Go to the Gen 8 tab of PokeFinder => Egg.

Input your parent's IVs, the nature, and the gender (or Ditto if used). Don't forget to check the Masuda button if you go for it. Shining Charm is in the profile options. Deposite your parents in the daycare, open CaptureSight, and go to the "Daycare" part. You'll have a Step Counter at 180. It'll reset to that value every time you deposite any parent. This means that in 180 steps, an egg will be generated OR not. So the goal, is to go to your room (not your irl room boi, the player's room in the first town) and do the steps there. 

Once the Step Counter is at 1, save your game here and close it

Reload your game. With CaptureSight, get the states on the title screen, and input them on PokeFinder. Then take the control of your game again

Note : PokeFinder states doesn't work the same as CaptureSight because we like to make things difficult. So you'll have to enter them in this order : 
- 1st state of PokeFinder : 2nd state of CaptureSight / 1st state of CaptureSight
- 2nd state of PokeFinder : 4th state of CaptureSight / 3rd state of CaptureSight

Generate the results. Find your target advance, and use all the methods to get close to hit.
Once at the right advance, move your character. Some tips to be accurate : Move your character in the opposite direction of where they're standing, and use the stick and not the pad. 

Then you can use CaptureSight to check the Egg Seed in the Daycare Menu. It should match the one in PokeFinder. If so you can take your egg, the RNG is done. Otherwise you'd have to try again.
