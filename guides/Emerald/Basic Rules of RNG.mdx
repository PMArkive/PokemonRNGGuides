## Intro

Emerald has useful features for RNG seeding, but vblank issues can be frustrating.

## RNG Methods

- For stationary Pokémon: Method 1.
- For wild encounters: Method H-2.

```
When dealing with wild encounters, it's often hit-or-miss. You might have a high vblank rate, making it hard to predict which method to use. There's no guaranteed solution, and you might need to try repeatedly, wasting time for uncertain results.
```

## Trainer Card Flip

In Gen 3, flipping your Trainer Card resets noise-related delays, helping you focus on the default delay. You should do this almost reflexively. Access your Trainer Card and press `A`. Do this between 10k-5k advances before your target advance to save yourself trouble.

## Minimizing Noise

To reduce vblank and noise issues, open your Trainer Card at the start of your RNG, perform a flip, close it, and then advance to your target advance. It's a simple but effective strategy.

## Speeding Up RNG Advances (Including Seeding Help)

### Battle Video

This method helps with seeding by preserving the RNG's state as an initial seed. Engage in a battle at the Battle Frontier and save it as a video. The video retains the seed from the battle, allowing you to set it as the initial seed when loading. For example, if your target is 1 million advances away, go up to 950k, save a battle video, and upon loading, you'll start at 950k advances.

While this method is helpful, it's a bit outdated compared to Painting RNG. However, it’s useful when you need to hit a specific advance multiple times.

### In-Battle

Being in battle advances RNG twice as fast. This is particularly helpful for wild Pokémon RNG.

### Painting RNG

Painting RNG is a great method to obtain any desired initial seed. It's a more advanced technique and will be covered in a separate guide.
