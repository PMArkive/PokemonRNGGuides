7. Filter by the Pokémon you want.
8. Click "Generate" and then find a desired Pokémon from the results.

## Step 2: Set Up EonTimer

1. Open EonTimer and click the cog in the lower-left corner.
2. Select the console you are using.
3. Then choose the Gen 3 tab.
4. Input the target advance from PokeFinder for the desired Pokémon in the "Target Frame" box.
5. Click "Start".

## Step 3: Calibration

1. When the timer reaches 0, reset the game by pressing `Start + Select + A + B`.
2. Open the in-game menu and go to your party.
3. Select the Pokémon with Sweet Scent and hover over "Sweet Scent."
4. Wait for the second countdown to end, then press `A`.
5. Catch the Pokémon and use the IV calculator under filters.

## Step 4: RNG the Pokemon

Now that you've calibrated for delay, it's all about timing.
Keep catching Pokémon and checking what advance you landed on.
Adjust EonTimer if needed.
If off by one or two advances, try again without changes.
