# Apply 3DS IPS Patches to Citra

_This currently only works in the Canary version of Citra_

1. Right click on your game in Citra
2. Open the update directory
3. Make a new folder called `<.app file>.exefsdir`
    - For example, Ultra Moon's update would be `00000001.app.exefsdir`
4. Put your `code.ips` in the new folder
