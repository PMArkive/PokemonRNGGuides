`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Shiny Charm or Masuda will be a MUST HAVE in order to perform egg RNG. This is because if you don't have either the SC or Masuda, egg is generated when you pick it from the old man. Since Solaceon Town is a very noisy place, it is very difficult to do RNG in front of the old man. Using Masuda or SC changes generation to the moment it is available to pick up, after a set amount of steps. This allows you to fly to a quiet and stable place to advance frames, and take the step to generate the egg while at the quiet place."}),`

Make sure you input your actual TID/SID not your G8TID etc. You may use any method to get these details, such as looking at the data of a self-obtained mon through a save editor like PKHex. While you are creating your profile, you should also check the Shiny Charm box if you have it."}),`

This makes it easy to hit your target without missing it. Here, you can take steps until the step counter is at 1. Here, you can save your game and restart, so you can return easily if you mess up. If you want to use another method to advance, you may use that."}),`

Once at the right advance, move your character. Some tips to be accurate : Move your character in the opposite direction of where they're standing, and use the stick and not the pad.`}),`

If your target is fairly far away, you can use the Pokedex to advance quickly. Press X to open menu, and go to pokedex. You can hold left and right on your joystick to quickly scroll through the Pokedex, which advances your frames very quickly. You can also scroll down the Pokedex normally to advance at a slightly slower rate. Make sure not to overshoot your advances."}),`
