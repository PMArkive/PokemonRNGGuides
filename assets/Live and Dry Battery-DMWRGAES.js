`,e.jsxs(t.p,{children:["How Live Battery would work for Retail ? Well it's simple. You'd either have to remove the Battery, put it back in order to reset the clock, and then wait the right time, at the right date to go for your RNG. You'd pretty much have one try to do your RNG since only one minute to be on the right Initial Seed. Seems tedious right ? To avoid that hassle, there's a tool that allows you to fix / set an RTC : ",e.jsx(t.a,{href:"https://github.com/megaboyexe/GBA_RTCRead",children:"https://github.com/megaboyexe/GBA_RTCRead"})," With that you can easily set any RTC to a working battery game and then do your Live Battery RNG.
