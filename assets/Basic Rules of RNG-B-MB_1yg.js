`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"In Gen 3, performing a Trainer Card Flip resets the noise-related delays, allowing you to focus on the default delay. It's a crucial step you should do almost reflexively. Simply access your Trainer Card and press A. To keep it simple, do this between 10k-5k advances before your target advance. This can save you a lot of trouble."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{children:"Minimizing Noise"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Building on the previous tip, a way to minimize vblank and noise issues is to open your Trainer Card when starting your RNG, perform a flip, close it, and advance to your target advance. This might sound simple, but it's an effective strategy to shield yourself from unexpected surprises."}),`

`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Compared to Emerald, Fire Red, or Leaf Green, Ruby and Sapphire lack many options for speeding up RNG advances. However, like any Gen 3 game, being in a battle accelerates the RNG advancement by a factor of two. This is particularly useful for wild Pokémon RNG."}),`
